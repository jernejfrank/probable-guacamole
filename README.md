## Statistical Learning Pipelines

I am working through [this book](https://www.statlearning.com)<sup>1</sup> to expand my working knowledge of machine learning approaches and will be implementing their examples using tools I like. I will probably play around and deviate from the author's implementations. Nevertheless, all credits go to them for putting together this fantastic resource - check out their [repo](https://github.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP).
